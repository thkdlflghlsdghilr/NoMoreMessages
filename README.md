# NoMoreReports
## A minecraft plugin that disables chat reporting on all types of messages
###### Tested and working verions: 1.19+
⚠️Warning⚠️ - selector specifications (eg. @e[type=pig] or @a[distance=..10]) won't work on the commands /w, /msg, and /tell. It will work as if it's just @e or @a
### Release: [Here](http://https://github.com/thkdlflghlsdghilr/NoMoreMessages/releases "Here")
### How does it work?
So, basically, whenever a player sends a message, the message gets deleted and sent again as a system message signed by the server, that way, it is impossible to report players, because the messages recived are from the server and not from the player.
### TODO
- [x] Disable chat reporting
- [x] Add selectors
- [ ] Add selectors specifications
